# How to Use Your Campaign Map

## Super Simple Setup

### 1. Open the Map
**Just double-click `BattleOfTrenton.html`** - that's it! Everything works.

### 2. Folder Structure
```
map/
├── BattleOfTrenton.html          ← DOUBLE-CLICK THIS!
└── campaign-images/
    ├── washington-camp/          ← Each location has its own folder
    │   └── background.jpg        ← Just drop any image named "background.jpg"
    ├── old-barracks/
    │   └── background.jpg
    ├── river-crossing/
    │   └── background.jpg
    └── ... (one folder per location)
```

## Adding Background Images for Tactical Maps

### Simple 2 Steps:

1. **Find or create** a floor plan, battle map, or building image
2. **Create a folder** for the location and drop the image as `background.jpg` inside

### Location Folders:
```
campaign-images/washington-camp/background.jpg     ← Washington's Encampment
campaign-images/river-crossing/background.jpg      ← Delaware River Crossing
campaign-images/old-barracks/background.jpg        ← The Old Barracks ⭐ (main quest)
campaign-images/rall-hq/background.jpg             ← Rall's Headquarters
campaign-images/king-street/background.jpg         ← King Street Battery
campaign-images/queen-street/background.jpg        ← Queen Street Battery
campaign-images/assunpink/background.jpg           ← Assunpink Creek Bridge
```

**Note:** Placeholder images from Wikipedia are shown until you add your own!

### Supported formats:
- `.jpg` (recommended)
- `.png`
- `.webp`

## How It Works

### Exploring the Campaign Map
1. Click any **location marker** (the colorful pins)
2. Or **hover over pins** to see faction info (Continental Army, Hessian, etc.)
3. Or click **location cards** in the sidebar
4. View info with **📖 Info** button
5. Enter location view with **→ Enter** button

### Using Location Detail View
1. Click **→ Enter** on any location
2. **Show Grid** for 5ft tactical grid (D&D-style combat)
3. Can adjust grid size (5ft, 10ft, 30ft) if needed
4. **Zoom in** to see building/tent details
5. Background images show automatically if you added them!

### DM Mode vs Player Mode
- **🎲 DM Mode** (default): Shows hidden info like prisoner locations, quest objectives
- **👥 Player Mode**: Hides DM-only information for sharing with players
- Toggle in top-right corner (same area as map layers)
- Great for sharing the map with your players without spoilers!

### Saving Your Progress
- **Auto-saves** every 30 seconds
- **Export** to backup your save
- **Import** to restore or share
- **Reset** to start fresh

## Tips & Tricks

### Where to Find Background Images
1. **Google Images**: Search "old barracks floor plan" or "tavern battle map"
2. **Pinterest**: Tons of historical building layouts
3. **DnD Resources**: r/battlemaps, dungeondraft.net
4. **Historical Sites**: Many museums have floor plans online
5. **Draw Your Own**: Use any image editor

### Image Best Practices
- Higher resolution = better quality when zoomed
- Transparent PNGs work great for floor plans
- Don't worry about perfect sizing - the map auto-fits

### Making It Cool Together
**Tell me what you want and I'll build it:**
- "Add a tavern interior for Rall's HQ"
- "Make the Old Barracks have multiple floors"
- "Add enemy markers to tactical maps"
- "Create a character for each location"

## Working Together

### You do:
✅ Find/add images to folders
✅ Tell me what locations need
✅ Describe what you envision

### I do:
✅ Code new features
✅ Add tactical details
✅ Create special effects
✅ Build new campaigns

## Quick Reference

### Tabs in Sidebar
- **📍 Locations**: All 7 locations in the campaign
- **🖼️ Images**: Guide for naming image files
- **💾 Save**: Save, export, import, reset
- **❓ Help**: Built-in tutorial

### Map Layers
- **Satellite**: Aerial photo view (default)
- **Street**: Road map view
- **Terrain**: Topographic view

### Location Types (Color Coded)

## What's Next?

### Easy Improvements We Can Add:
1. **Enemy tokens** on tactical maps
2. **Multiple floor levels** for buildings
3. **Character portraits** that pop up
4. **Custom markers** for important items
5. **Notes system** for each location

### New Campaigns We Can Build:
- Different historical battles
- D&D adventures
- Star Wars locations
- Any setting you want!

## Troubleshooting

### Images not showing?
- Check the filename exactly matches (e.g., `old-barracks.jpg` not `Old Barracks.jpg`)
- Make sure it's in the `campaign-images/tactical/` folder
- Try `.jpg` format first

### Map not loading?
- Make sure you're opening `BattleOfTrenton.html`
- Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Check your internet connection (needed for map tiles)

### Save not working?
- Browser localStorage might be disabled
- Try Export/Import instead
- Private/Incognito mode won't persist saves

## Let's Build!

Just tell me:
- What images you have
- What you want to add
- What would make it cooler

I'll do the coding, you do the creative direction! 🎲⚔️🗺️
